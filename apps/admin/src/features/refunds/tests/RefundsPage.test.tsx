/**
 * Test cases:
 *
 * - The preview route resolves the Refunds page with its header and subcopy.
 * - The four status pills render with their counts.
 * - The table shows a guest refund awaiting transfer and a member refund
 *   already credited, with the right payout column for each.
 * - A `balance` refund offers no work actions — it settled when it was opened.
 * - A guest refund's menu offers claim / complete / reject.
 * - "Mark as transferred" confirms with the amount and destination before the
 *   mutation fires.
 * - "Reject refund" requires a reason before the mutation fires.
