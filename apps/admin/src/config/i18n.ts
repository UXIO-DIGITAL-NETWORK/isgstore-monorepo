 * difference: **no locale segment in the URL**. The storefront needs one so a
 * product page can be linked in a given language; a back-office screen is not
 * shared that way, and the cost of rewriting every route was not worth paying.
 * The choice lives on `users.locale` instead, so it follows an admin to a new
 * device — which a URL prefix could not do either.
 *
 * One namespace per feature slice, plus `common` and `navbar` for the shell.
 * Adding one means three edits in this file — the imports, both `resources`
 * maps, and the `ns` array. The storefront's CLAUDE.md flags that last one as
 * the step people forget, and it is the reason the three lists are kept
 * adjacent rather than scattered.
